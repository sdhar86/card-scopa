### Tuts+ Course: Building a Multi-Player Game With Meteor
#### Instructor: Andrew Burgess

Meteor is an amazing framework that makes building complex web applications much simpler. It's easy-to-use APIs, straighforward database system, and "live-by-default" nature make an application that would normally take days to build possible in hours. In this course, we're going to go from nothing at all to a deployed and usable multi-player game in just a couple of hours.
